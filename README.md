# parallel-computing
Using C++ to do some experiments about parallel computing with multi-threads.

+ finds and prints all primes between 1 and pow(10,10). The task is to implement a parallel version of this program using threads and a concurrent data structure in C/C++.

+ computing the product of two n Ã— n matrices and the 1D Fast Fourier Transform of a n-coordinate vector on a shared memory multi-processor parallel computing system.
